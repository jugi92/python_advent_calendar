# python_advent_calendar

In this repository I will put up some small python coding challenges that can be used to learn and improve your python skills.
While some challenges will be generic, some are about the aviation industry and data processing in that area.

Even though it is called an advent calendar there will be a surprise only every second day, meaning every odd day from the first of December until 23rd of December.
The solutions to the problems will always be published one day later.

If you have suggestions or input feel free to open issues in the GitHub repository or comment under the posts where you saw the link to this repository.
As always Google is your friend and I am looking forward to see some solutions that I did not think of.
Most of the challenges can be done within 10 lines, which does not automatically mean that those are easy problems. 

I am trying to allow the participation with as little preparation as possible. You will only need your browser to participate.
The challenges can be done either in databricks or even in the freely available google colab. Try to use the [door_0](tasks/Task_00_Door_0.ipynb) example in the tasks folder to check your setup.

Follow the videos below to find out how to set up the respective account:

- [Databricks Video Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GeQAUHd7WcE)  
You need to have access to a databricks workspace. Either your company already set up one for you or you can do that yourself here: https://docs.databricks.com/getting-started/index.html

- [Google Colab Video Intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z88_MOyAarY)  
For Google Colab you need a google account and then you can sign in here: https://colab.research.google.com/
If you are not really used to git workflows you can open the notebooks one by one as shown in the video above. If you are experienced with the git workflows or want to learn more about them you can clone/fork this repository to your own github and then run the notebooks in colab by visting https://colab.research.google.com/github/ where you find your repositories.

Let us all improve our skills bit by bit, exchange about it and thus be prepared to have a good start into 2021.

### First Door

Christmas preparations started. Find the first challenge under tasks in the file [Task_01_confused_airports.ipynb](tasks/Task_01_confused_airports.ipynb)
The solution will be provided tomorrow, 2nd of December and the next challenge will be published on the 3rd of December.
